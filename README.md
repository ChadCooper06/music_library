### Project Setup
1. Create a new repo with a .sql file and eventually a screenshot of the DB design from dbdiagram.io in it.
2. DB should have at least four tables in it with multiple foreign keys for relationships between them.
3. Three queries each for CRUD operations for your tables (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
4. All create tables queries.
